## Info

This repository serves as the central location for documentation on our Microbiome Taxonomy Workflow. Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/BeeCSI-Microbiome/Microbiome-Taxonomy-Workflow/wiki) for documentation.

The workflow begins with a Snakemake pipeline, which can be found [here](https://github.com/BeeCSI-Microbiome/taxonomic_profiling_pipeline).

The workflow continues with post-pipeline analyses in R and can be found [here](https://github.com/BeeCSI-Microbiome/R_analyses).
